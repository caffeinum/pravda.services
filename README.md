BTC -> ETH

Alice wants to sell BTC and buy ETH, Bob owerthise wants to sell ETH and buy BTC.

 1. Alice creates order 1 BTC -> 10 ETH
 2. Bob pushes a 'Buy' button in the orders list and is redirected to /eth-to-btc/:id page.
 3. Alice is notified about Bob and is redirected to /btc-to-eth/:id page.
 4. Alice is asked to create a 'Secret Key'.

 12. Alice signs a call to the ETH Swap contract to withdraw ETH.
